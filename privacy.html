  <h1>Privacy Policy for FAS–CRM</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 26, 2025</p>

  <h2>No Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    At this time, the mobile application <strong>CRM Mobile</strong> does not collect,
    store or transmit any personal data or usage data to us or to third parties.
    The App only displays static interface elements and does not include user registration,
    login or analytics.
  </p>

  <h2>Future Changes</h2>
  <p>
    If we later add features such as user authentication, analytics or any other
    type of data processing, we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly.
