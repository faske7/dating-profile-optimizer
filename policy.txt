1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

A) Information you provide

In Short: We collect information you choose to provide when using the App.

This may include:
	•	Text you submit for analysis (e.g., bio, chat text, prompts, language/tone preferences).
	•	Images/files you select (e.g., chat screenshots, PDFs, TXT) only if you choose to upload them for analysis.
	•	Support messages if you contact us (e.g., email address and the content of your request).

B) Information collected automatically

In Short: Some technical data is collected automatically for security and app reliability.

This may include:
	•	Device/App Data (device model, OS version, app version, language, time zone).
	•	Identifiers (e.g., an app-generated device identifier such as device_id).
	•	Log & Diagnostics Data (crash reports, performance data, error logs, timestamps).
	•	Network Data such as IP address (or proxy/server info), typically visible to backend services.

We do not intentionally collect precise GPS location. Any location inferred from IP is typically approximate (country/region) and used for security/analytics.

2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

We process information to:
	•	Provide the Service (generate AI-based analysis and reply suggestions based on what you submit).
	•	Maintain security and prevent abuse (rate limiting, fraud prevention, protecting infrastructure).
	•	Improve reliability (debugging, crash diagnostics, performance monitoring).
	•	Provide support (answering user requests).

⸻

3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

Where applicable (e.g., EEA/UK), we rely on:
	•	Consent (when you choose to upload/submit content for analysis).
	•	Performance of a contract (to deliver requested features).
	•	Legitimate interests (security, service improvement, preventing abuse).
	•	Legal obligations (if required by law).

⸻

4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

We may share information with:
	•	Cloud hosting and storage providers (to run backend infrastructure).
	•	AI processing providers (to generate analysis and reply suggestions).
	•	Diagnostics providers (crash/performance reporting), if enabled.

We share only what is necessary to operate the Service.
We do not sell your personal information and we do not share it for third-party advertising.

⸻

5. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?

The App may link to third-party websites (e.g., Terms/Privacy pages). We are not responsible for third-party privacy practices.

⸻

6. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?

If you use our website, it may use cookies for basic functionality and analytics.
The mobile App typically does not use browser cookies; it relies on device/app diagnostics and logs.

7. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?

Your information may be processed in countries where our servers or service providers operate. We take reasonable steps to protect data during transfers.

⸻

8. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

In Short: We keep data only as long as needed.

Uploaded content for analysis (screenshots/files/text):
	•	Not stored long-term. We process it to produce results and then delete it from our servers [immediately / within X hours / within X days].

Generated results:
	•	Stored locally on your device (e.g., in on-device storage) unless you explicitly send them again.

Logs/diagnostics:
	•	Retained for [e.g., 30 days] for security and reliability.

Самый “Apple-friendly” вариант для v1: удаляем загрузки сразу после обработки (или “within 24 hours”).
