  <h2>1. The Services</h2>
  <p>
    FASSS is a dating conversation optimizer. The App can generate reply suggestions and analysis based on
    content you choose to provide, such as chat text, screenshots, and profile/bio text.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are responsible for complying with laws where you live and for how you use the suggestions produced by
    the App.
  </p>

  <h2>2. AI Features — Important Notice</h2>
  <p>
    The App uses automated systems to generate suggestions. AI outputs may be inaccurate, incomplete, or
    inappropriate for your specific situation.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No guarantee of outcomes.</strong> We do not guarantee any results (matches, dates, relationship outcomes, etc.).</li>
    <li><strong>Not professional advice.</strong> The Services are not legal, medical, psychological, or therapeutic advice.</li>
    <li><strong>You remain responsible.</strong> You decide what to send to other people and are responsible for your messages and behavior.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you are in danger or facing an emergency, do not rely on the App.</p>

  <h2>3. Accounts &amp; Security</h2>
  <p>If the App uses accounts, device identifiers, or sign-in methods:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and account access.</li>
    <li>You agree not to share access in a way that violates these Terms.</li>
    <li>You must provide accurate information when required.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We may suspend or restrict access if we reasonably believe there is misuse, fraud, or a security risk.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    We (or our licensors) own all rights in the Services, including the App software, branding, design, and all
    content provided by us (“Our Content”). You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or exploit the Services
    except as permitted by these Terms.
  </p>
  <p>
    We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Services for
    personal, non-commercial use, as long as you comply with these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>5. User Content &amp; Library Storage</h2>

  <h3>5.1 What you can submit</h3>
  <p>
    You may submit content such as text, screenshots, images, or profile/bio information (“User Content”) to
    generate analysis and reply suggestions. The App may allow you to save items to a personal library (the
    “Library”) for later access.
  </p>

  <h3>5.2 You are responsible for your User Content</h3>
  <p>You represent and warrant that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>you have the right to submit the User Content;</li>
    <li>your User Content does not violate laws or third-party rights (privacy, copyrights, etc.);</li>
    <li>you will not upload content that is illegal, threatening, hateful, harassing, sexually exploitative, or otherwise harmful.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If your screenshots or text include another person’s information, you are responsible for using it lawfully
    and respecting their privacy.
  </p>

  <h3>5.3 Permission to process and store</h3>
  <p>To provide the Services, you grant us a limited license to host, store, reproduce, and process your User Content:</p>

    <li>to store your saved content in your Library and make it accessible to you;</li>
    <li>to maintain, secure, troubleshoot, and improve reliability of the Services.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This license is worldwide, non-exclusive, and royalty-free, and continues for as long as your User Content
    remains stored in the Library or as needed to provide the Services, unless law requires longer retention.
  </p>

  <h3>5.4 Removing Library content</h3>
  <p>
    You may remove items from your Library using the App’s available controls (if implemented). We may also
    remove or restrict User Content if we reasonably believe it violates these Terms or creates legal/security
    risk.

  <p>
    The App may depend on third-party providers (e.g., hosting, analytics, AI processing). We are not
    responsible for third-party services outside our control. Your use of them may be governed by their own
    terms and policies.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Mobile App License</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>rent, sell, sublicense, or commercially exploit the App;</li>
    <li>modify or create derivative works;</li>
    <li>use the App to build a competing product.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you obtained the App through Apple App Store or Google Play, you must also follow their terms.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Payments (Currently Not Offered)</h2>
  <p>
    At this time, the Services are provided without subscriptions or paid plans. If we introduce paid features
    in the future, we will update these Terms and provide pricing details in the App.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Termination</h2>
  <p>
    We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms, if required by law, or to protect the
    Services, users, or third parties. You may stop using the Services at any time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sections that by their nature should survive termination (intellectual property, disclaimers, limitation of
    liability, indemnification, disputes) will continue to apply.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Changes &amp; Availability</h2>
  <p>
    We may change or discontinue parts of the Services at any time. We do not guarantee uninterrupted

    SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING FROM OR
    RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.

    nothing, the cap is USD $20.)
  </p>
  <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so some of these limits may not apply to you.</p>
